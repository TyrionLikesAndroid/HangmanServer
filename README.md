# HangmanServer
This code is for a simple Spring Boot hangman server I made for one of my graduate classes.  It has the following endpoints:
- startGame - to create a game session
- guessLetter - to guess a letter and see your progress
- guessPhrase - if you want to guess the phrase before getting all of the letters
